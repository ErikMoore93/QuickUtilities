# QuickUtilities
Utilities built to make my life easier. These are probably not polished

ZeroPad.py - Simply pads text files with leading zeros if total length including path is less than 7 characters
openCMDhere.bat - Opens command prompt in whatever directory the .bat is located
newPyWHeader.bat - Copies HeaderTemplate.py and renames it, essentailly a template creator
